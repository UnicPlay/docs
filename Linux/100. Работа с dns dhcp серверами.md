A Brief Overview of Turtles
=====================

Turtles are unique and ancient reptiles that belong to the order Testudines. They are characterized by their protective shells, which consist of a dorsal carapace and a ventral plastron joined together by bony bridges.

Shell
-------
The turtle's shell is made up of individual bony plates called scutes, which are covered in keratin. The shell's primary function is to provide protection from predators, but it also plays a role in maintaining body temperature and buoyancy.

Classification
------------------
Turtles are divided into two main suborders: Cryptodira and Pleurodira. Cryptodires retract their necks straight back into their shells, while pleurodires bend their necks sideways. There are approximately 360 species of turtles found across the world, inhabiting a wide range of environments.

Habitat
---------
Turtles can be found in various habitats, from freshwater ponds and rivers to oceanic waters and terrestrial ecosystems. Some turtle species, such as the Galapagos giant tortoise, primarily live on land, while others, like sea turtles, spend most of their lives in the ocean.

Diet
------
Turtles have diverse diets depending on their species and habitat. Some turtles are herbivores, feeding on plants and algae, while others are omnivores, consuming both plant and animal matter. Some species, such as the snapping turtle, are primarily carnivorous, preying on fish, insects, and other small animals
